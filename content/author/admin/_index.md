I'm a Senior Lecturer in Data Journalism at [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/arts-social-sciences/journalism).

Prior to that I was founding co-director of the [MSc in Computational and Data Journalism](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc), a joint honours course in journalism and computer science.

I'm also a co-founder of the [European Data and Computational Journalism Conference](http://datajconf.com/). My interests include data journalism, journalism and software development, social media and production journalism.
