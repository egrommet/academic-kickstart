      <description>I’ve just got back from the third European Data and Computational Journalism Conference in Malaga, Spain, and thought I’d share a few thoughts about the event.
This is the third time the I’ve helped organise this conference, along with my co-chairs Martin Chorley (Cardiff University) and Bahareh Heravi (University College Dublin), and the first one I’ve done since moving to City, University of London.
More than 100 people took part in the two days, with participants coming from 14 countries.</description>
